  "summary": "REQ-48 appears implemented by updating the Get Involved page to use a shared OFFICE_ADDRESS constant with the correct Jharkhand address text. However, REQ-49 (site-wide removal of the old Bihar address strings) cannot be fully verified from the provided diff summary because it doesn’t show a comprehensive removal of those old strings beyond the updated Get Involved page and refactoring Contact/Footer to use the constant.",

      "requirement": "Audit the frontend for any remaining occurrences of the old address text (\"Vill-Bhagatpur, P.O-Bhagatpur\", \"P.S-Bhagatpur, Dist-Samastipur\", \"Bihar, India - 848503\") and replace/remove them so the old address is not displayed anywhere on the site.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows the Get Involved page now imports and presumably displays OFFICE_ADDRESS, and Footer/Contact were refactored to use the same constant, but it does not provide evidence of a site-wide search/removal of the old address strings across all other pages/components where they might still exist.",
