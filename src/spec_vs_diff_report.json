However, based on the provided diff summary, there is not enough evidence that the previous locations text is removed everywhere else on the site or that all other displays of the Economic Empowerment locations were updated.",

      "reason": "The diff only shows the location update in `ProgramsImpactPage.tsx`. No other UI locations (e.g., homepage featured programs preview or any other components/pages that might also display program locations) are shown as updated, so site-wide removal of the old text cannot be confirmed from this diff summary.",
