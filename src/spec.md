# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Correct the NGO impact metric wording so the value “15” is described as states served (not countries) everywhere it appears.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page impact metrics strip label for the “15” metric from “Countries Served” (or “Countries”) to “States Served” (or equivalent wording that clearly indicates states).
- Update the Programs/Impact page “Collective Impact” summary label for the “15” metric to “States Served” (or equivalent wording that clearly indicates states).
- Ensure only the copy/label changes and the numeric value “15” remains unchanged across the site.

**User-visible outcome:** Anywhere the site shows the “15” impact metric, it will read as “States Served” rather than “Countries Served,” without changing any metric values.
