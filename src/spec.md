# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the displayed location(s) served for the “Economic Empowerment” program to “India, Jharkhand” across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “Economic Empowerment” program’s “Locations Served” text to exactly “India, Jharkhand” on the Programs & Impact page (/programs).
- Replace any other occurrences on the site where “Economic Empowerment” locations are shown so the previous list (“Cambodia, Myanmar, Bolivia, Nicaragua”) is no longer displayed.

**User-visible outcome:** Anywhere the site shows the Economic Empowerment program’s locations (including the /programs card), it will display “India, Jharkhand” and not the prior non-India locations.
