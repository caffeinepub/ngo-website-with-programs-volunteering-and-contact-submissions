# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Ensure the correct Samarpan Trust office address is shown on the Get Involved (Volunteer) page and remove any remaining instances of the old address across the site.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the /get-involved “Our Address” block to display: "Chhaperwa, Sandh, Barkagaon, Hazaribagh, Jharkhand 825311", matching the Contact page and footer.
- Audit the frontend for the old address strings and replace/remove them so the old address is not user-visible anywhere in the built UI.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the correct office address on the Get Involved page, and the old Bihar address no longer appears anywhere on the site.
